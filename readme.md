# "Capstone Project - I"  Proposal

The website, I am going to build, will be a nutrient and calorie content log of daily consumed foods for the users. Users would be able to enter the amount of every food they eaten during the day, and the website will connect to an API to get the nutrition info of the relevant food. The nutrition info I want to include, are carbs, net carbs (for Keto diet), fat, protein, and sugar for now.

Users would be able to create their accounts in the website with a username and password. When they login to their accounts they will be able to see their already entered food logs for each separate day. There will be a calender feature to make possible to browse through the days, for each corresponding food log. There will also be a feature to see nutrient and calorie sum/average for a period of time specified by the user.

The user will be able to create, read, edit, and delete any food entry for any day. The database will contain two tables: [users & food_logs](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/16HER8Z3KmN-mbUIALi8C0DKeYLNxTHT35uLNohaH2dk/edit?usp=sharing).
